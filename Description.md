The program uses a for loop to repeadetly print the value of integer i.
First the program defines i to be equal to 1, then in the for loop it checks that it is below 5000.
After each iteration the loop  sets i = 2 * i + 1.
So each time the result is multiplied by 2 then one is added.
The result is 1 then 3 then 7 and so on with each line starting with "count is: ," using System.out.println.
Finally it keeps repeating until it hit 4095 because if it were to repeat one more time i would be greater than 5000.
